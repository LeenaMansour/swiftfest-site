We want **SwiftFest** to be, as much as possible, a great **learning experience** for all of you. For this reason, we summarized the frequently asked questions so that you can find here the answers you are searching for easily.

##### 1. Do you have a Code of Conduct?

Yes we do, the Code of Conduct is available [here](/code-of-conduct/) for your review. If you have questions or concerns about the Code of Conduct itself, or the behavior of any participants before, during or after the conference, you can email us at [conference@swiftfest.io](mailto:conference@swiftfest.io) or reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/theSwiftFest).

##### 2. Do you have an app?

Yes! And it's [open source](https://github.com/swiftfest/)!

##### 3. Which is the speaker reimbursement policy?

We would love to be able to cover all speaker expenses, but as an independent conference in Boston, thatâ€™s tough. If you require financial assistance, please reach out to us once your talk has been selected and before **June 9th** so that we have time to get everything ready.

SwiftFest Boston 2019 provides the following support to our awesome speakers:

> - Up to $200 for domestic flights, up to $400 for international flights
> - Up to 2 nights at the conference hotel.

If your **employer** can accommodate your **travel expenses**, let us know and they will be listed as a **community sponsor** on all our media.
